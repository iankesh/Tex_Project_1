Helloo!! This is my \LaTeX\ Document.\\
The sum of $(x+1)$ and $(x-1)$ is $x$. There are a lot of formulas in mathematics and those are written by Ankesh.

It is my great pleasure to announce the ACE award winner. The main formula is $$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^{23} + 2ab$$ and it can be written and followed.
$$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^{2x+3} + 2ab$$
It is my great pleasure to announce the ACE award winner. The main formula is $$(a+b)_2 = a_2 + b_{23} + 2ab$$ and it can be written and followed.
$$(a+b)_2 = a_2 + b_{2x^{23}+3} + 2ab$$

$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,a_{100}$$
$$a = \pi$$
$$a = \Pi$$
$$a = \beta$$
$$a = \Delta \delta$$

$$a = \sin x$$
$$a = \csc^{-1} y$$
$$a = \sin \theta$$
